## Literature for Report
From the 2/25 email: I added some literature to the Box folder (in the “articles” directory). I’ve listed the file names (all pdfs) below along with my sense about what decision point each focuses on (from a very quick skim, so possibly incorrect). I’ve starred the ones that struck me as a higher priority (some are cited in the Research Synthesis, some are newer). 

Everyone should select one of the starred articles that you’ll be responsible for reading and for providing a 1-page annotation for, focusing on elements we might want to use in the report we’re writing. This will include the citation, the specific research question, the method for answering the question, a summary of findings, and how these fit into our work. 

These will be due on **Friday, March 16!** If you want to start right away, email me to claim an article (as long as no one else has claimed it, it’s yours). Otherwise, we’ll get them divvied up during lab this coming Friday (3/2).

If you’ve had to miss in the past, this is your chance to do a little extra to contribute — pick an unstirred article and do a second annotation (but email me to let me know you’d like to claim it, in case someone else has already emailed me to claim it).
